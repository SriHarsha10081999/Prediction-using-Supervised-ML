Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn.

In this section we include how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will be seeing simple linear regression involving two variables.

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
